create folder :- codeal

create file : index.js

now we initialize our project : open terminal and write :- npm init

now we have to make our project scallable( so we create directory )

Starting Express:-
    install Express   :- npm install express
    require in our index.js

now we import our express in index.js

we create app.listen in index.js

WE CAN RUN OUR SERVER USING  npx nodemon index.js
    ->instead of above method we can also go in package.json and edit scripts and 
        ->add there "start":"npx nodemon indexjs",


now we initialize git -> using git init

but now we realize that : folder node_modules is very heavy and this is nothing but all the modules that anyone can download using npm install 

so we ignore that using : making file in main_location and file name would be : .gitignore : and inside that we type :node_modules/ : which can ignore the folder
